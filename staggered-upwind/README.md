Compatible diagonal-norm staggered and upwind SBP operators
============================================================================================


This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of compatible staggered and upwind SBP operators of the first derivative.

* *sbp_staggered_upwind.m* provides a common interface for constructing operators of order 2, 4, 6, 8 (referring to the
  order of accuracy of the difference approximations used in the interior).

  Additional details are provided in the comment section of the function.
