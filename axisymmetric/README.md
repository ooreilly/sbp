Treatment of the polar coordinate singularity in axisymmetric wave propagation using high-order summation-by-parts operators on a staggered grid
============================================================================================

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the radial component of the Laplacian operator using a
high-order summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference approximation. 

* *main.m* is a demo script that solves the diffusion equation in one dimension.
* *laplacian.m* is a function that constructs the Laplacian operator of a radial function
* *sbp_staggered.m* is a function that wraps the implementation of the high-order SBP operators.
